# andrewarrow's railsbasic

This is the start of every rails app for me:

* User model with clear text password in DB
* Sessions controller to login/out
* https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura for css
* Blog
* Email Forgot Password
* N number of flavors of users, so you can have Drivers/Riders but they are both Users
* Concept of current_user
* When logged in can update your user settings
